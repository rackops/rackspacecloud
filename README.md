Currently supported resources:

* Rackspace Cloud DNS ( rackspacecloud_record )
* Rackspace Cloud Files ( rackspacecloud_file )
* Rackspace Cloud Block storage ( rackspacecloud_cbs )
* Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers ( rackspacecloud_lbaas)

Coming soon:

* Rackspace Cloud Database
* Rackspace Cloud Servers

Not Included:

* Rackspace Cloud Monitoring: See [cookbook-cloudmonitoring](https://github.com/rackspace-cookbooks/cookbook-cloudmonitoring)

Requirements
============

Requires Chef 0.7.10 or higher for Lightweight Resource and Provider support. Chef 0.8+ is recommended. While this cookbook can be used in chef-solo mode, to gain the most flexibility, we recommend using chef-client with a Chef Server.

A Rackspace Cloud account is required. The username and API key are used to authenticate with Rackspace Cloud.

Rackspace Credentials
=====================

In order to manage Rackspace Cloud components, authentication credentials need to be available to the node. There are a number of ways to handle this, such as node attributes or roles. We recommend storing these in a databag item (Chef 0.8+), and loading them in the recipe where the resources are needed. To do so, make a data bag called ```rackspace``` with an item called ```cloud``` that has at least the following:

```json
{
  "id":"cloud",
  "rackspace_username": "<RACKSPACE_USERNAME>",
  "rackspace_api_key": "<RACKSPACE_APIKEY>"
}
```

You may choose to provide your ```rackspace_auth_url``` and ```rackspace_auth_region``` in the data bag item as well, but they can generally be safely provided as attributes.

The values can be loaded in a recipe with:

```ruby
rackspace = data_bag_item("rackspace", "cloud")
```

And to access the values:

```ruby
rackspace['rackspace_username']
rackspace['rackspace_api_key']
```

The data bag items can also be encrypted for extra security.

Recipes
=======

default.rb
----------

The default recipe installs the ```fog``` RubyGem, which this cookbook requires in order to work with the Rackspace API. Make sure that the default recipe is in the node or role ```run_list``` before any resources from this cookbook are used.

"run_list": [
  "recipe[rackspacecloud]"
]

The ```gem_package``` is created as a Ruby Object and thus installed during the compile phase of the Chef run.

Libraries
=========

The cookbook has several library modules which can be included where necessary:

```ruby
Opscode::Rackspace
Opscode::Rackspace::BlockStorage
Opscode::Rackspace::DNS
Opscode::Rackspace::Storage
```

Resources and Providers
=======================

This cookbook provides several resources and corresponding providers.

rackspacecloud_cbs
---------------------

Provides functionality to manage storage volumes and server attachments for Rackspace Cloud Block Storage including creating, attaching, detaching and deleting volumes.  All actions performed are idempotent.

### Actions:

```:create_volume``` - Creates a new storage volume with the given name.  If a volume with the given name exists no action will be taken.  This action does not accept volume_id as a parameter.

```:attach_volume``` - Attaches an existing storage volume to the current node.  If the volume is already attached no action will be taken.  If the volme is attached to another server, an exception will be raised. The volumes may be attached by name or by volume_id.

```:create_and_attach``` - The default action.  Combines create_volume and attach_volume into one action.  This action does not accept volume_id as a parameter.

```:detach_volume``` - Detaches a volume from an existing server.  If the given volume is not attached no action is performed.  If the volume is attached to another server, an exception will be raised.  The volume may be detached by name or volume_id.

```:delete_volume``` - Deletes an existing storage volume.  A volume must be detached in order to be deleted.  If the given volume does not exist no action will be taken.  The volume may be identified by name or volume_id.

```:detach_and_delete``` - Combines detach_volume and delete_volume into a single action.  Volume may be identified by name or volume_id.

### Examples:

Create and attach a 100GB SSD storage volume:

```ruby
rackspacecloud_cbs "myvolume-01" do
  type "SSD"
  size 100
  rackspace_username "userName"
  rackspace_api_key "apiKey"
  rackspace_region "ord"
  action :create_and_attach
end
```

Create a 200GB SATA volume:

```ruby
rackspacecloud_cbs "myvolume-02" do
  type "SATA"
  size 200    
  rackspace_username "userName"
  rackspace_api_key "apiKey"
  rackspace_region "ord"
  action :create_volume
end
```

Attach a volume by volume_id:

```ruby
rackspacecloud_cbs "myvolume-02" do
  volume_id "74fe8714-fd92-4d07-a6a2-ddd15ed09f79"    
  rackspace_username "userName"
  rackspace_api_key "apiKey"
  rackspace_region "ord"
  action :attach_volume
end
```

Detach a volume by name:

```ruby
rackspacecloud_cbs "myvolume-02" do  
  rackspace_username "userName"
  rackspace_api_key "apiKey"
  rackspace_region "ord"
  action :detach_volume
end
```

Detach and delete volume by id:

```ruby
rackspacecloud_cbs "myvolume-01" do 
  volume_id "74fe8714-fd92-4d07-a6a2-ddd15ed09f79" 
  rackspace_username "userName"
  rackspace_api_key "apiKey"
  rackspace_region "ord"
  action :detach_and_delete
end
```

### Node Attributes:

During the provider run, a node attribute is updated with a list of hashes describing the attached volumes.  The list of attached volumes is pulled from the compute and storage api so it will include all attached volumes whether created with this recipe or not.  The data is in the following format:

```ruby
node[:rackspacecloud][:cbs][:attached_volumes] = [
  {
    :device => '/dev/xvde',
    :size => 100,
    :volume_id => "4300a4b7-1b66-4d44-b18d-de1b3236b001",
    :display_name => "myvolume-01",
    :volume_type => "SSD"
  },
  {
    :device => "/dev/xvdb",
    :size => 200,
    :volume_id => "642a8a7b-cb31-479b-8e4c-0158a2be3519",
    :display_name => "myvolume-02",
    :volume_type => "SATA"
  }
]
```

### Example Recipe with LVM:

Below is an example of a simple recipe that creates 2 100GB cloud block storage volumes and uses LVM to create a logical volume group, format the filesystem, and mount at /var/log.  This example uses the [Opscode LVM recipe](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/lvm).

```ruby
include_recipe 'rackspacecloud'
include_recipe 'lvm'

rackspace = data_bag_item("rackspace", "cloud")
rackspace_username = rackspace["rackspace_username"]
rackspace_api_key = rackspace["rackspace_api_key"]

(1..2).each do |vol_number|
  rackspacecloud_cbs "#{node[:hostname]}-#{vol_number}" do
    type "SATA"
    size 100
    rackspace_username rackspace_username
    rackspace_api_key rackspace_api_key
    rackspace_region "#{node[:rackspace][:cloud][:region]}"
    action :create_and_attach
  end
end

#use lazy attribute evaluation to get attachment data at execution time
lvm_volume_group 'vg00' do
  not_if {node[:rackspacecloud][:cbs][:attached_volumes].empty? }
  physical_volumes lazy {node[:rackspacecloud][:cbs][:attached_volumes].collect{|attachment| attachment["device"]}}
  logical_volume 'blockstorage' do
    size        '100%VG'
    filesystem  'ext4'
    mount_point '/var/log'
  end
 end
```

### Attributes:
* ```name```: Name of the volume to perform operations with.
* ```volume_id```: The volume_id of the volume to attach, detach, or delete. This option is not valid for actions that create volumes.
* ```type```: The type of storage device, either [SSD, SATA]. Default is SATA.
* ```size```: The size in GB of strage device.  Default is 100.
* ```rackspace_username```: The Rackspace API username. Can be retrieved from data bag or node attributes.
* ```rackspace_api_key```: The Rackspace API key. Can be retrieved from data bag or node attributes.
* ```action```: ```:create_volume```, ```:attach_volume```, ```:create_and_attach```, ```:detach_volume```, ```:delete_volume```, ```:detach_and_delete```. Default is ```:create_and_attach```.
